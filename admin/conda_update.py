# JennAI Conda Environment Update Script
# ==============================================================================
#
# This script automates the process of synchronizing the 'jennai-root' conda
# environment with the 'environment.yaml' file.
#
# USAGE:
# 1. Make sure you are in your 'base' conda environment.
#    (Do NOT run this from within the 'jennai-root' environment).
# 2. Run this script from the project root directory:
#    python admin/conda_update.py
#
