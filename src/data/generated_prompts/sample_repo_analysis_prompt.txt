# Prompt to Determine Minimum System Requirements for a Software Repository

You are an expert system analyst AI. Your task is to analyze the provided information extracted from a software repository and determine its minimum system requirements.

## Repository Context
*(Optional: If available, provide a brief description of the repository's purpose or name. Placeholder: No repository description provided.)*

## Information Extracted from Repository Files:

### 1. Content from README.md:
```text
# VisoMaster - Advanced Computer Vision Toolkit

VisoMaster is a comprehensive Python-based toolkit designed for advanced computer vision tasks, including object detection, image segmentation, and video analysis. It leverages state-of-the-art deep learning models and provides a flexible framework for researchers and developers.

## Features

- Real-time object detection
- Instance and semantic segmentation
- Video stream processing
- Model training and fine-tuning capabilities
- Support for various datasets and annotation formats
- Modular design for easy extension

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.10+
- NVIDIA GPU with CUDA 11.8 support (Recommended for full performance)
- Conda for environment management

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/VisoMaster.git
   cd VisoMaster
   ```
2. Create and activate the Conda environment:
   ```bash
   conda env create -f environment_cu118.yml
   conda activate visomaster
   ```
3. Install pip dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements_cu118.txt
   ```

## Task:
Based on all the provided information above, please synthesize and list the minimum system requirements for this repository.
Focus on identifying requirements for the following categories if the information allows:

- **Operating System(s):** (e.g., Linux, Windows, macOS; specific versions or distributions if inferable)
- **CPU:** (e.g., minimum cores, architecture like x86_64, arm64, if inferable)
- **System RAM:** (e.g., minimum GB)
- **GPU:** (e.g., "NVIDIA GPU required", "AMD GPU required", "Any modern GPU"; minimum VRAM in GB; specific series like "NVIDIA RTX 20-series or newer"; minimum CUDA version if NVIDIA and inferable; minimum Compute Capability if inferable)
- **Disk Space:** (e.g., minimum GB for installation, dependencies, and typical datasets)
- **Python Version:** (e.g., "3.8+", "==3.9.x")
- **Key Software Dependencies or Runtimes:** (e.g., "CUDA Toolkit 11.8", "cuDNN 8.x", "Node.js 16+", specific compilers, database versions)

If information for a category is not clearly available or cannot be reasonably inferred from the provided text, please state "Not specified" or "Cannot be determined from provided information" for that category. Be cautious about making assumptions if the text is not explicit.

## Desired Output Format:
Please provide the minimum system requirements as a JSON object. Use the following keys if applicable, and add others if necessary. If a value cannot be determined, use `null` or "Not specified".

```json
{
  "operating_system": "Linux (e.g., Ubuntu 20.04+)",
  "cpu_architecture": "x86_64",
  "cpu_cores_min": 4,
  "ram_min_gb": 8,
  "gpu_required": true,
  "gpu_type_preference": "NVIDIA",
  "gpu_vram_min_gb": 6,
  "gpu_cuda_version_min": "11.8",
  "gpu_compute_capability_min": "6.1",
  "disk_space_min_gb": 50,
  "python_version_min": "3.9",
  "key_software_dependencies": ["CUDA Toolkit 11.8", "cuDNN 8.x"]
}
```

Analyze the provided text carefully and generate the JSON output.
