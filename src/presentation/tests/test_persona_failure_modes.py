"""
COMPREHENSIVE PERSONA FAILURE MODE TESTS

This test suite expands beyond basic entanglement testing to comprehensively
validate specific failure modes, edge cases, and recovery scenarios.

Tests are grouped by failure category:
1. Critical Infrastructure Failures (missing files, directories, configs)
2. Dependency Chain Failures (persona-specific dependencies)
3. Cascade Propagation Failures (failure ripple effects)
4. Recovery Mechanism Failures (healing and restoration)
5. Edge Case Scenarios (partial failures, circular recovery)
6. Platform-Specific Failures (OS, environment, tool-specific)
7. Performance Degradation Failures (resource exhaustion, timeouts)

Each test validates both the failure detection and the expected cascade/recovery behavior.
