Defines the abstract testing contract for any presentation layer.

These tests are intentionally marked with `pytest.mark.skip` because this
file serves as a template or interface. Each concrete presentation layer
(e.g., Flask, FastAPI, a command-line interface) should have its own test
file that provides a concrete implementation for each of these tests.
