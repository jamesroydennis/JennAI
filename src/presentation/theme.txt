Intent: "Minimalist and modern tech logo for 'PyRepo-Pal', an AI-Github assistant.

Design Elements: Consider a stylized letter 'P' subtly integrated or intertwined with abstract neural network patterns, subtle circuit lines, or a clean, abstract representation of a thought process or data flow. The 'AI' part could be represented through these tech elements or a modern, clean typeface.

Style: Clean vector art, sleek, professional, and innovative. The logo should feel intelligent and approachable, not overly complex or intimidating.

Color Palette: [

"#34495E",

"#D0D1D2",

"#848D93"

]

primary font color:rgb(100, 113, 126)

Overall Feel: The logo should be suitable for a sophisticated software project, conveying trust, intelligence, and cutting-edge technology."
