# --- Custom Markers ---
# Register custom markers here to avoid warnings and typos.
markers =
    integration: marks tests as integration tests (e.g., testing full application startup).
    reporting: marks tests related to reporting features (e.g., Allure).

    
# --- Test Discovery ---
# Define where pytest should look for tests.
testpaths =
    src/business/tests
    src/data/tests

    tests

# --- Common Options ---
# Add command-line options here to avoid typing them every time.
# -v:  verbose mode (shows one line per test).
# -ra: show extra test summary information for all tests (Ran, Skipped, etc.).
addopts = -v -ra

# Note: Logging is configured in conftest.py using Loguru for rich, consistent output.
# The standard pytest log_* options are not used in this project.
