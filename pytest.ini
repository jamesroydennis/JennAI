# This file centralizes pytest configuration.

# --- Test Discovery ---
# Define where pytest should look for tests.
testpaths =
    src/business/tests
    src/data/tests

# --- Common Options ---
# Add command-line options here to avoid typing them every time.
# -v: verbose mode
addopts = -v

# Note: Logging is configured in conftest.py using Loguru for rich, consistent output.
# The standard pytest log_* options are not used in this project.

# --- Custom Markers ---
# Register custom markers to avoid PytestUnknownMarkWarning.
markers =
    integration: marks tests as integration tests (can be slow)
    system_check: marks tests that verify system-level dependencies and setup
