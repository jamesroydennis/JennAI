    "# PyRepo-Pal: AI-Assisted Python Environment Management\n",
    "\n",
    "This document outlines a brainstorming idea for PyRepo-Pal, a tool using a multi-tiered, AI-assisted approach to analyze Python repositories, determine their system and dependency requirements, and help create tailored Conda environments or `requirements.txt` files. The goal is to provide an optimal and compatible setup, adapting to general or specialized hardware (like GPUs) as inferred from the repository's needs.\n",
    "\n",
    "## High-Level PyRepo-Pal Workflow\n",
    "\n",
    "This outlines the general sequence of operations envisioned for PyRepo-Pal. It's a high-level overview and subject to refinement as the project evolves.\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Collect Data:** Gather raw data from primary sources. This involves:\n",
    "    *   **User System Information:** Profiling the user's local machine (OS, CPU, RAM, GPU, disk, Python versions) using the `/src/business/sys/sys_profiler.py` script. The output (`hardware_specs.json`) is stored in `/src/data/system_info/`.\n",
    "    *   **Target Repository Data:** Reading key files from the specified Python project repository (`README.md`, `requirements.txt`, `environment.yaml`, any existing explicit requirements files). This will be handled by a new script (e.g., `/src/business/ai/repo_data_collector.py`). The collected raw text data will be processed and potentially stored temporarily or passed directly to the AI prompt generation stage.\n",
    "    *   **(Implicit) User Configuration/Intent:** Parameters provided by the user when running PyRepo-Pal (e.g., target repo path, desired output format, specific flags).\n",
    "    *(Note: External APIs for package metadata might be queried in later analysis steps rather than initial bulk collection.)*\n",
    "2.  **Process Data:** Clean, transform, and structure the collected raw data into a usable format.\n",
    "3.  **Analyze Data - Level 1:** Perform initial analysis on the processed data to extract basic insights and identify key characteristics (e.g., primary language, presence of dependency files).\n",
    "4.  **Persist Data as Information:** Store the results of the initial analysis and processed data in a structured way (e.g., `hardware_specs.json`, parsed repository file contents).\n",
    "5.  **Process Information:** Further refine and combine the persisted information, preparing it for more in-depth analysis.\n",
    "6.  **Analyze Information (AI-Assisted):** Leverage AI (e.g., Gemini) to perform deeper analysis on the processed information. This includes:\n",
    "    *   Determining likely minimum system requirements (Step 1A of Multi-Tiered Approach).\n",
    "    *   Characterizing the environment and high-level dependencies (Step 4, Stage 1 of Multi-Tiered Approach).\n",
    "    *   Resolving detailed and compatible dependency versions (Step 4, Stage 2 of Multi-Tiered Approach).\n",
    "7.  **Display Deliverables (Edit Mode):** Present the AI-generated findings and proposed environment configurations to the user in an editable format, allowing for review and modification.\n",
    "8.  **Re-Analyze if Necessary:** If the user makes significant changes or requests adjustments, re-engage the AI or processing steps with the new input.\n",
    "9.  **Persist Deliverables:** Save the final, user-approved environment specifications (e.g., `environment.yml`, `requirements.txt`, final system requirements summary).\n",
    "10. **Provide User Final Deliverables:** Make the persisted deliverables available to the user for setting up their environment or for documentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Proposed Multi-Tiered Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "The envisioned process involves the following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Analyze Repository & User's System:**\n",
    "    *   **Action (Phase A - AI-Driven Requirement Analysis):** Use Gemini (with the `generate_min_sys_reqs_from_repo_prompt.md` template) to analyze the target repository's files (`README.md`, `requirements.txt`, `environment.yaml`, existing requirements docs). Goal: Have AI determine the *likely* minimum system requirements (OS, CPU, RAM, Python version, and importantly, whether specialized hardware like GPUs seems necessary).\n",
    "    *   **Action (Phase B - User Hardware Profiling):** Programmatically collect details about the user's system using `sys_profiler.py` (OS, CPU, RAM, disk, Python versions, and if available, GPU details). This profile (`hardware_specs.json`) provides the 'actual' state of the user's machine.\n",
    "    *   **Action (Phase C - Prerequisite Check):** Compare the AI-determined requirements (from Phase A) against the user's actual hardware profile (from Phase B). If fundamental requirements (e.g., OS, minimum RAM, or a required GPU type if AI indicated one) are not met, inform the user and potentially halt or offer guidance.\n",
    "    *   **Rationale:** This approach first uses AI to understand the *repository's* needs, then checks if the user's system is a potential match before proceeding to detailed environment configuration. It avoids assuming specialized hardware upfront.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  **Generate Hardware Information File:**\n",
    "    *   **Action:** Store the queried hardware details in a structured, intermediate file (e.g., JSON or YAML).\n",
    "    *   **Rationale:** Creates a clear, inspectable artifact for debugging, logging, and as input for subsequent steps. It also allows for potential caching.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  **Utilize Prompt Templates with Placeholders:**\n",
    "    *   **Action:** Develop pre-defined prompt templates for interacting with Gemini. These templates will include placeholders for the hardware information gathered in step 2.\n",
    "    *   **Rationale:** Ensures consistent and manageable AI interactions. The specific hardware details can be injected into these templates to customize the queries.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.  **AI-Powered Dependency Resolution & Environment Specification:**\n",
    "    *   **Stage 1: Environment Characterization & High-Level Dependencies Query:**\n",
    "        *   **Input:** Content from the repository's `requirements.txt`, `environment.yaml`, and potentially key phrases from `README.md` indicating project type or critical dependencies. User's Python version(s) from `hardware_specs.json`.\n",
    "        *   **Goal with Gemini:** \n",
    "            *   Identify the primary Python version suitable for the project.\n",
    "            *   Determine if the project requires specialized hardware (e.g., NVIDIA GPU, specific accelerators) based on its dependencies (e.g., `tensorflow-gpu`, `pytorch+cuda`, `jaxlib[cuda]`).\n",
    "            *   If specialized hardware is indicated, identify the type (e.g., NVIDIA CUDA) and any version constraints mentioned or implied by packages.\n",
    "            *   List core dependencies and their high-level version constraints.\n",
    "        *   **Rationale:** To understand the nature of the required environment (general Python, or specialized like CUDA-enabled) before diving into exact package versions.\n",
    "    *   **Stage 2: Detailed & Compatible Dependency Versioning Query (Conditional):**\n",
    "        *   **Input:** Insights from Stage 1, the user's detailed hardware specs from `hardware_specs.json` (especially GPU model, driver version if Stage 1 indicated GPU needs), and the list of packages from the repository.\n",
    "        *   **Goal with Gemini:**\n",
    "            *   **If specialized environment (e.g., CUDA):** Determine exact compatible versions for all dependencies, including specific builds (e.g., `pytorch==X.Y.Z+cuABC`, `cudatoolkit=U.V`, `cudnn=S.T`). The AI should consider the user's *actual* driver and GPU capabilities.\n",
    "            *   **If general Python environment:** Resolve a compatible set of versions for all listed Python packages, respecting any version specifiers in the original files and ensuring they work with the chosen Python version.\n",
    "        *   **Output:** A precise list of packages and versions suitable for generating an `environment.yml` (for Conda) or a `requirements.txt` file.\n",
    "        *   **Rationale:** To leverage AI for the complex task of finding a fully compatible set of dependencies, tailored to the user's system if specialized hardware is involved, or a robust general Python environment otherwise.\n",
    "\n",
    "5.  **(Post-Generation) Verify with Post-Install Script:**\n",
    "    *   **Action:** After the environment is created using the Gemini-generated files, run a verification script (e.g., `verify_installation.py`, potentially adapted to use dynamically generated expected versions).\n",
    "    *   **Rationale:** Confirms that the environment was created as specified and that all components are functioning correctly, providing a final quality assurance check."

    "\n",
    "This is indeed a fascinating challenge! We're looking to leverage the analytical power of Gemini to synthesize information from various common repository files and infer the minimum system requirements. This is a smart way to automate a task that often requires manual reading and interpretation.\n",

    "\n",
    "- **Operating System(s):** (e.g., Linux, Windows, macOS; specific versions or distributions if inferable)\n",
    "- **CPU:** (e.g., minimum cores, architecture like x86_64, arm64, if inferable)\n",
    "- **System RAM:** (e.g., minimum GB)\n",
    "- **GPU:** (e.g., \"NVIDIA GPU required\", \"AMD GPU required\", \"Any modern GPU\"; minimum VRAM in GB; specific series like \"NVIDIA RTX 20-series or newer\"; minimum CUDA version if NVIDIA and inferable; minimum Compute Capability if inferable)\n",
    "- **Disk Space:** (e.g., minimum GB for installation, dependencies, and typical datasets)\n",
    "- **Python Version:** (e.g., \"3.8+\", \"==3.9.x\")\n",
    "- **Key Software Dependencies or Runtimes:** (e.g., \"CUDA Toolkit 11.8\", \"cuDNN 8.x\", \"Node.js 16+\", specific compilers, database versions)\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Analyze the provided text carefully and generate the JSON output.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation of the Template:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Placeholders (`{{...}}`): These are where the actual content extracted from the repository files will be injected by your Python script before sending the prompt to Gemini.\n",
    "- Context for Missing Files: The template includes notes on how to represent missing information (e.g., \"README.md not found or empty\"). This helps Gemini understand the completeness of the provided data.\n",
    "- Clear Task Definition: It explicitly tells Gemini what to do and what categories of system requirements to focus on.\n",
    "- Guidance on Uncertainty: It instructs Gemini on how to handle cases where information isn't available.\n",
    "- Desired Output Format (JSON): Specifying JSON output makes Gemini's response programmatically parsable, which is crucial for using these determined requirements later (e.g., comparing them with actual system specs from `sys_profiler.py`).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Next Steps (Conceptual):**\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  Develop a Python script (perhaps in `src/business/ai/` or `src/business/sys/`) that:\n",
    "    *   Takes a path to a target repository as input.\n",
    "    *   Reads the `README.md`, `requirements.txt`, `environment.yaml`, and any existing `min-sys-requirements.txt` file from that repository.\n",
    "    *   Populates this `generate_min_sys_reqs_from_repo_prompt.md` template with the extracted content.\n",
    "    *   Uses your `AIGenerator` (or a similar service) to send the filled prompt to the Gemini API.\n",
    "    *   Receives and parses the JSON response from Gemini.\n",
    "2.  This script would effectively implement \"Phase A - Prerequisite Check\" from your `pyrepopal.ipynb` plan, but by using AI to *determine* the requirements first, rather than just checking against a predefined file.\n",
    "\n",
    "This prompt template is a key component in your plan to use AI for understanding and setting up repository environments!\n"
